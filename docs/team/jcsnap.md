## Project Name: TaskWise

TaskWise is a task managing application used by CS2103/T task managers.
The user interacts with it via the Command Line Interface (CLI) and it has a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) made using JavaFX. It is written in Java, and it has about 10813 LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* New Feature: Note
    * What it does: Adds a note to a task.
    * Justifications: There might be additional information that the user wants to add to a task, but is too long to be included in the description.
    * Highlights: It can be edited in the edit command as well.
    * Credits: NIL
* New Feature: View
    * What it does: Displays the complete imformation of the task in the side panel.
    * Justifications: It is useful for the user to see the complete information of the task. It is a cli implementation of "clicking" the task.
    * Highlights: Using esc will clear the side panel with the selected task.
    * Credits: NIL
